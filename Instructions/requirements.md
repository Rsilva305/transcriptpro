## 1. Document Header

*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** May 13, 2025

## 2. Project Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an AI-powered transcription service. The service will convert audio and video files into accurate, timestamped text transcripts using advanced artificial intelligence models.

**Purpose:** To provide individuals and professionals with a fast, reliable, and accessible tool for converting spoken content into editable text, significantly reducing the manual effort involved in transcription.

**Goals:**
*   Successfully implement core AI transcription functionality for common audio/video formats.
*   Establish a secure and user-friendly platform for file upload, management, and basic editing.
*   Validate the technical feasibility and initial market demand for the service.
*   Acquire an initial user base and gather feedback for future product development.
*   Implement a freemium model structure to understand usage patterns and potential conversion rates.

**Target Users:**
*   Content Creators (Podcasters, YouTubers) needing transcripts for accessibility, show notes, or search engine optimization.
*   Students and Researchers transcribing lectures, interviews, or focus groups.
*   Journalists transcribing interviews.
*   Business Professionals transcribing meetings, webinars, or conference calls.
*   Anyone requiring conversion of spoken content to text for analysis, archiving, or accessibility.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-001: Performance**
    *   Transcription Processing Time: Target average transcription time for a 60-minute audio file should be under 10-15 minutes (dependent on AI model and infrastructure, establish realistic target).
    *   User Interface Responsiveness: Page load times and interactions within the application should be fast (e.g., < 3 seconds).
    *   Upload Speed: File upload speed dependent on user's connection but system should handle parallel uploads efficiently.

*   **NFR-002: Security**
    *   Data Encryption: User uploaded files and generated transcripts shall be stored securely with encryption at rest. Data in transit shall be encrypted using HTTPS/SSL.
    *   Authentication Security: Passwords shall be stored using strong hashing algorithms. Session management shall be secure.
    *   Authorization: Users shall only be able to access and manage files they have uploaded.
    *   Compliance: Adhere to basic data privacy principles (e.g., GDPR or equivalent, simplified for MVP if necessary, but user data protection is key).

*   **NFR-003: Reliability**
    *   Uptime: The service should target an uptime of 99% during core operational hours.
    *   Error Handling: The system should handle failures gracefully, provide informative error messages to the user (e.g., transcription failed due to unsupported format), and log errors for debugging.
    *   Data Integrity: Ensure that uploaded files and generated transcripts are not lost or corrupted.

*   **NFR-004: Scalability**
    *   The underlying infrastructure and architecture should be designed to handle a growing number of users and increased file processing volume without significant refactoring for initial growth phases. (MVP foundation for future scale).

*   **NFR-005: Usability**
    *   User Interface: The UI for core flows (upload, view files, edit transcript, export) shall be intuitive and easy to navigate for the target audience.
    *   Clear Feedback: Users should receive clear and timely feedback on system actions (e.g., upload progress, processing status, save confirmation, errors).

## 5. Dependencies and Constraints

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **AI Transcription Engine:** Reliance on a specific AI transcription model API (e.g., OpenAI Whisper API, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe, or a self-hosted open-source model like Whisper). The capabilities and limitations of this engine directly impact FR-003 and FR-004.
    *   **Cloud Storage:** Dependency on a cloud storage solution (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for storing uploaded files and transcripts.
    *   **Database:** Dependency on a relational or NoSQL database for managing user data, file metadata, and transcript text.
    *   **Email Service:** Dependency on an email service provider for user registration confirmation and password reset functionality.

*   **Constraints:**
    *   **Timeline:** The MVP must be developed and launched within a defined timeframe (e.g., X months), limiting the scope of features.
    *   **Budget:** Development, infrastructure, and AI service costs are constrained by the available budget.
    *   **AI Model Limitations:** The chosen AI model may have limitations regarding language support, accuracy in noisy audio, speaker separation capabilities (excluded from MVP FRs for simplicity), or specific file format compatibility.
    *   **File Size/Duration:** Initial infrastructure choices may impose practical limits on the maximum file size and duration that can be processed efficiently or economically.

## 6. Risk Assessment

*   **Risk-001: AI Transcription Accuracy Variability:** The accuracy of the transcript can vary significantly based on audio quality, accents, background noise, and the AI model's inherent limitations.
    *   *Impact:* Poor accuracy leads to a frustrating user experience and high manual editing effort, potentially reducing user retention.
*   **Risk-002: Performance Bottlenecks:** Slow transcription processing times under load or large file uploads could make the service unusable or expensive.
    *   *Impact:* Users abandon long processing jobs; high infrastructure costs if not managed efficiently.
*   **Risk-003: Data Security Breach:** User files and sensitive transcript data could be compromised.
    *   *Impact:* Loss of user trust, potential legal issues, damage to reputation.
*   **Risk-004: User Adoption and Freemium Validation:** The service may not attract sufficient users, or free users may not convert to paying users in the future.
    *   *Impact:* Unsustainable business model; failure to achieve project goals.
*   **Risk-005: Technical Integration Challenges:** Difficulty integrating with the chosen AI transcription API or managing the processing pipeline.
    *   *Impact:* Development delays, increased costs, potential scope reduction or feature compromise.
*   **Risk-006: Vendor Lock-in or Cost Escalation (AI/Cloud):** Heavy reliance on a specific third-party AI provider or cloud service could lead to increased costs or difficulty switching later.
    *   *Impact:* Higher operational costs, reduced flexibility.
