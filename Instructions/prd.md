**Document Header**

*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** May 13, 2025

**Executive Summary**

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a new AI-powered transcription service. The service will enable users to upload audio and video files and receive accurate, fast text transcripts. The MVP focuses on delivering core functionality: a reliable transcription engine, secure user authentication and file management, a basic text editor for corrections, simple export options, and a freemium model to allow users to try the service. This foundation will provide immediate value to professionals, researchers, content creators, and students, establishing a base for future feature expansion and growth.

**Product Vision**

Our vision is to become the leading platform for converting spoken audio and video into accessible, editable, and actionable text. We aim to empower individuals and businesses by eliminating the inefficiencies of manual transcription and providing a reliable, accurate, and easy-to-use AI solution.

*   **Purpose:** To provide a fast, accurate, and affordable way for users to convert audio and video content into text, making information more accessible and usable.
*   **Target Users:** Professionals (journalists, legal, medical), researchers, content creators (podcasters, videographers), students, and anyone needing to extract textual information from spoken word recordings.
*   **Business Goals:**
    *   Achieve product-market fit by solving the core problem of transcription efficiently.
    *   Acquire a user base through a compelling freemium offering.
    *   Establish a scalable technical infrastructure.
    *   Gather user feedback to inform future product iterations and premium features.
    *   Lay the groundwork for future revenue generation through paid tiers.

**User Personas**

1.  **Persona Name:** Sarah, The Journalist
    *   **Background:** Freelance journalist who conducts numerous interviews. Needs to quickly transcribe interviews to write articles. Often records in variable audio environments.
    *   **Goals:** Get accurate transcripts quickly, easily correct names/jargon, keep interviews organized.
    *   **Pain Points:** Manual transcription is extremely time-consuming. Existing tools are often inaccurate with background noise or multiple speakers (though MVP may not fully solve multi-speaker). Managing dozens of audio files and transcripts is cumbersome.

2.  **Persona Name:** David, The Content Creator
    *   **Background:** Podcaster and YouTube creator. Needs transcripts for show notes, blog posts, and video captions (future feature need, not MVP). Values speed and ease of use.
    *   **Goals:** Quickly get a transcript from his audio/video files. Make minor edits for readability. Easily export text for other platforms.
    *   **Pain Points:** Transcribing hours of content manually is unsustainable. Accuracy is important, but speed and flow are key for getting content out quickly. Needs a simple workflow.

**Feature Specifications**

This section details the core MVP features.

### 1. Audio/Video Transcription Engine

*   **Description:** The core engine that takes uploaded audio/video files and converts the speech within them into text using AI models.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to upload an audio or video file so that the service can transcribe it for me.
    *   As a user, I want the transcription process to start automatically after I upload a file so I don't have to take extra steps.
    *   As a user, I want to see the current status of my transcription job (e.g., Uploading, Processing, Complete, Failed) so I know what's happening.
    *   As a user, I want the transcription output to include timestamps so I can locate specific points in the original media.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The system MUST accept standard audio file formats (e.g., MP3, WAV, AAC, FLAC) and video file formats (e.g., MP4, MOV, AVI).
    *   Maximum file size for upload MUST be enforced (e.g., 200MB or 60 minutes duration, whichever comes first). This limit should be clearly communicated to the user.
    *   Upon successful upload, the file is queued for transcription processing.
    *   The transcription process SHOULD use the configured AI transcription model.
    *   The output MUST be text with timestamps indicating the approximate start time of spoken segments (e.g., `[00:05] Hello, this is a test. [00:08] And here's another sentence.`).
    *   The user interface MUST display the status of the transcription job in the file management view.
    *   A notification (visual indicator in UI) MUST inform the user when transcription is complete or fails.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Unsupported file format uploaded.
    *   File exceeds the maximum size or duration limit.
    *   File is corrupted or unreadable.
    *   Upload fails or is interrupted before completion.
    *   Audio quality is very poor (excessive background noise, distant speaker, heavy accent).
    *   File contains multiple speakers (MVP engine may not differentiate speakers, outputting a single block of text - this limitation should be understood).
    *   File contains only silence or non-speech audio.
    *   Transcription service encounters an internal error and fails to process the file.

### 2. User Authentication and File Management

*   **Description:** Allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their uploaded files and associated transcripts.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a new user, I want to create an account using my email address so I can use the service.
    *   As a returning user, I want to log in securely to access my files and transcripts.
    *   As a user, I want to see a list of all the audio/video files I have uploaded and their status.
    *   As a user, I want to delete a file and its transcript from my account to manage my storage or privacy.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Users CAN sign up with a valid email address and password. Password MUST be stored securely (hashed).
    *   Users CAN log in using their registered email and password.
    *   A basic password reset mechanism (e.g., via email link) MUST be available.
    *   A dashboard or file list view MUST display all files uploaded by the logged-in user.
    *   Each item in the file list MUST show the original filename, upload date, duration, and current transcription status.
    *   Users CAN select or click on a file entry to navigate to the transcript editor (if transcription is complete).
    *   Users CAN initiate the deletion of a specific file and its associated transcript data.
    *   Upon deletion confirmation, the file and transcript MUST be permanently removed from the user's account and storage.
    *   Users MUST NOT be able to access files or transcripts belonging to other users.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Attempting to sign up with an already registered email.
    *   Logging in with incorrect credentials.
    *   Attempting to access file management or editor pages without being logged in (redirect to login).
    *   User account is suspended or deleted by an administrator (though admin features are outside MVP scope, the system should handle this state).
    *   Attempting to delete a file that is currently processing (deletion request should be queued or denied with a message).
    *   User uploads multiple files with the same filename (system should handle naming conflicts, e.g., by appending a number or timestamp).

### 3. Basic Transcript Editor

*   **Description:** A web-based interface allowing users to view the completed transcript and make simple text edits.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to view the automatically generated transcript for my uploaded file.
    *   As a user, I want to be able to correct errors in the transcript text (typos, misinterpretations).
    *   As a user, I want my edits to the transcript to be saved.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The editor MUST display the complete transcript text for a selected file, including timestamps as generated by the engine.
    *   The text content within the editor MUST be editable by the user (standard text input functionalities like typing, deleting, pasting).
    *   Changes made in the editor MUST be saved. Auto-save functionality triggered by user inactivity or typing pauses is preferred over a manual save button for a better user experience.
    *   The editor MUST NOT allow editing of files that are still processing or have failed transcription.
    *   Timestamps SHOULD be displayed but NOT be directly editable by the user in this MVP version.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Connectivity loss while editing (auto-save needs to handle potential data conflicts or inform the user of failure to save).
    *   Attempting to access the editor for a file that has been deleted.
    *   Attempting to edit a transcript that is excessively large (potential performance issues - system should remain responsive or indicate loading).
    *   User pastes formatted text (editor should ideally strip formatting or handle it gracefully).

### 4. Export Options

*   **Description:** Allows users to download the completed and edited transcript in a common text format.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to download my transcript as a simple text file so I can use it in other applications.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A clear button or link to initiate export MUST be available on the transcript view page.
    *   The system MUST provide an option to export the transcript as a plain text file (.txt).
    *   The exported text file MUST contain the current, potentially edited, version of the transcript.
    *   Timestamps SHOULD be included in the exported plain text file by default.
    *   The filename of the exported file SHOULD be based on the original uploaded file name (e.g., `my_interview.txt`).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Attempting to export a transcript that is still processing or has failed.
    *   Attempting to export a transcript for a file that has been deleted.
    *   Export fails due to server error or connectivity issue during file generation/download.
    *   Original filename contains characters that are invalid for filenames in certain operating systems (system should sanitize filename).

### 5. Freemium Model Implementation

*   **Description:** Defines and enforces usage limits for free tier users, allowing them to experience the service before needing to subscribe.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a free user, I want a limited amount of transcription time each month to try the service.
    *   As a user (free or potentially future paid), I want to see how much transcription usage I have consumed and how much is remaining in my current period.
    *   As a free user, I want to be informed when I am approaching or have reached my monthly usage limit.
    *   As a free user, I want my usage limit to reset periodically (e.g., monthly).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A specific monthly transcription limit MUST be defined for free users (e.g., 60 minutes of audio/video duration per calendar month).
    *   The system MUST accurately track the total duration of successfully transcribed audio/video for each user within the current billing cycle (month).
    *   The user dashboard or a dedicated usage page MUST display the user's consumed usage and remaining quota for the current period.
    *   When a free user attempts to upload a file that would cause their total usage to exceed the monthly limit, the upload MUST be blocked.
    *   A clear message MUST inform the user that they have reached their free limit and cannot transcribe the file. (Link to future upgrade options can be placeholders).
    *   Usage counter MUST reset to zero at the start of each calendar month for all users.
    *   Files that fail transcription SHOULD NOT count against the user's usage quota.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User uploads a file whose duration is slightly more than their remaining quota (entire file is blocked).
    *   Calculation errors in usage tracking.
    *   Timezone complexities for monthly resets (define a standard UTC reset time).
    *   Attempting to transcribe a file shortly before the monthly reset that exceeds the *current* remaining quota but would be within the *new* quota (should be blocked based on current quota).

**Technical Requirements**

*   **API Needs:**
    *   `POST /api/auth/signup`: User registration.
    *   `POST /api/auth/login`: User login.
    *   `POST /api/auth/password/reset`: Initiate password reset.
    *   `POST /api/files/upload`: Handles secure upload of audio/video files. Requires authentication.
    *   `GET /api/files`: List authenticated user's files with metadata (filename, date, duration, status).
    *   `GET /api/files/{fileId}/status`: Get specific file's transcription status.
    *   `DELETE /api/files/{fileId}`: Delete file and associated data. Requires authentication.
    *   `GET /api/transcripts/{fileId}`: Retrieve the transcript text and timestamps for a completed file. Requires authentication.
    *   `PUT /api/transcripts/{fileId}`: Save updates to the transcript text. Requires authentication.

    *   `GET /api/user/usage`: Retrieve user's current freemium usage details. Requires authentication.
*   **Data Storage Requirements:**
    *   Secure storage for raw uploaded audio/video files (e.g., S3 bucket, Google Cloud Storage). Must handle large files and ensure privacy.
    *   Database storage for:
        *   User information (hashed passwords, email, metadata).
        *   File metadata (user ID, original filename, stored location, size, duration, upload date, transcription status, job ID).
        *   Transcript data (file ID, the transcribed text with timestamps).
        *   Usage tracking data (user ID, current month's used minutes, last reset date).
    *   Scalable database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) capable of handling potential growth in users and file metadata.
